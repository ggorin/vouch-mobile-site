# Geographic & Location-Based Phone Plan Keywords Research

**Last Updated:** January 14, 2026
**Research Focus:** State, city, and metro area phone plan searches for Vouch (AT&T MVNO)

---

## Executive Summary

Geographic and location-based phone plan keywords represent significant opportunity for Vouch's SEO strategy. While commercial ("best phone plans," "cheapest unlimited") and comparison keywords are highly competitive, location-based keywords offer better conversion potential because they indicate users seeking local solutions. This research covers state-level, city-level, and proximity-based keyword patterns critical for Vouch's content strategy.

### Key Findings

- **State + Plan Type keywords** (e.g., "california phone plans," "texas unlimited data") show consistent search demand with medium-to-high commercial intent
- **Major metro searches** (NYC, LA, Chicago, Houston) have significant volume but high competition from comparison sites
- **"Near me" searches** are declining in literal usage, but proximity modifiers and local intent remain important for SEO
- **Prepaid + No-credit-check keywords** in geographic context have lower competition and higher commercial intent
- **Seasonal trends** show peaks during back-to-school (July-August) and holiday shopping (November-December)

### 3. "Near Me" & Proximity Keywords

#### Pattern: "Phone Plans Near Me"

**Current SEO Reality (2025-2026):**
- Google now treats "near me" as a **proximity signal**, not a literal keyword to match
- Exact match "[Keyword] near me" is **outdated and potentially harmful** to ranking strategy
- Geographic intent is better captured through location-specific content pages and schema markup

#### Strategic Approach Instead of "Near Me"

**Recommended Methods:**
1. **Create location-specific landing pages** (e.g., `/coverage/california/`, `/coverage/new-york/`)
2. **Use proper local schema markup** (LocalBusiness, ServiceArea schema)
3. **Target "city + keyword" combinations** instead of "near me" variations
4. **Optimize Google Business Profile** for local visibility
5. **Build NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency** across directories

**"Near Me" Keyword Variants (Lower Value):**
- "Phone service near me" - DON'T optimize for literal match
- "Affordable plans near me" - Better to use city-based pages
- "Prepaid phone plans near me" - Use state + city pages instead

### 4. Seasonal Keyword Trends

#### Back-to-School Period (July-August)

**Related Keyword Patterns:**
- "Best phone plans for students [state/city]"
