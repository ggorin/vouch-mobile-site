## 3. Hotspot Data

### Definition
Mobile hotspot data is a cellular feature that allows you to share your phone's internet connection with other devices (tablets, laptops, other phones) by broadcasting a personal Wi-Fi network. The hotspot feature uses a portion of your cellular data plan.

### How It Works
When you enable hotspot on your phone, it connects to the cellular network and broadcasts that connection as a small Wi-Fi network. Other devices can then join this Wi-Fi network the same way they would connect to any standard Wi-Fi, using the phone as a portable router. The hotspot converts your cellular data connection into a shareable wireless signal.

### Data Usage Rates
- **Typical usage range**: 60 MB/hour to 810 MB/hour
- **Varies by activity**:
  - HD video streaming: High usage (100-200+ MB per hour)
  - Regular web browsing: Low to moderate (20-50 MB per hour)
  - Social media scrolling: Low (10-30 MB per hour)
  - Online gaming: High (50-150+ MB per hour)
  - Video calls: High (50-150+ MB per hour)

### Data Usage Examples
- **1 hour of HD Netflix**: Approximately 3-5 GB
- **1 hour of regular web browsing**: 20-50 MB
- **1 hour of video conferencing**: 1-2 GB
- **Streaming music**: 1-2 MB per song

### Plan Limitations
While many carriers advertise "unlimited" hotspot data, most plans include conditions:
- **High-speed threshold**: You may get 25 GB, 50 GB, or 100 GB of high-speed hotspot data per month
- **Deprioritization after limit**: Once you exceed the limit, speeds may slow down (deprioritization)
- **Complete throttling**: Some plans throttle hotspot to 3G speeds or slower after the limit
- **Carriers with truly unlimited**: Limited options; check specific plan details

### Why It Matters to Phone Plan Buyers
- **Tablet/laptop internet on the go**: Eliminate need for separate home internet or data plan for second devices
- **Cost savings**: One data plan covers multiple devices instead of multiple plans
- **Flexibility**: Work from coffee shops or during travel without seeking Wi-Fi
- **Plan selection matters**: Choose plans with sufficient hotspot allowance for your usage
- **Usage monitoring**: Need to track which devices use the most data

### Related Terms
- Tethering

## 4. Deprioritization

### Definition
Data deprioritization is the temporary slowing of your mobile data speeds in favor of other subscribers on the same network, typically occurring during times of high network congestion or traffic. This is a network management technique that affects all users fairly when the network becomes congested.

### How It Works
During periods of heavy network usage, carriers slow down your data speeds to ensure fair bandwidth allocation across all users. Your data speeds return to normal once network congestion clears. Deprioritization is congestion-based and temporary—speeds recover automatically.

### Deprioritization vs. Throttling

| Feature | Deprioritization | Throttling |
|---------|------------------|-----------|
| **Cause** | Network congestion | Exceeding your monthly data limit |
| **Duration** | Temporary (until congestion ends) | Permanent until next billing cycle |
| **Speed** | Slowed but usually still usable | Often unusable (3G speeds or lower) |
| **Recovery** | Automatic when network clears | After billing cycle resets |
| **Occurrence** | Unpredictable | Predictable when you hit limit |
| **Fairness** | Affects everyone during congestion | Applies to heavy users over limit |

### Impact on Service
- **Noticeable impact**: Relatively uncommon to experience significant slowdown
- **Speed variability**: May notice slower speeds during peak hours (evenings, weekends)
- **Speeds recover**: Return to normal once the network clears
- **Data still works**: You can still browse and use apps, just slower

### When Deprioritization Happens
- Evening peak hours (6-10 PM)
- Weekends in crowded areas
- Major events or concerts
- Holiday periods with high usage

### Why It Matters to Phone Plan Buyers
- **MVNO reality**: Deprioritization is common on prepaid and MVNO plans
- **Not a contract violation**: Carriers can deprioritize legally under congestion
- **Fair network management**: Ensures network doesn't collapse during high usage
- **Plan comparison**: Some carriers have less deprioritization policies
- **Usage patterns**: Know when congestion typically occurs in your area

### Related Terms
- Throttling
- Network congestion
- QoS (Quality of Service)
- Data prioritization
- Network management

### Common Questions
- **Is deprioritization the same as throttling?** No; deprioritization is temporary and congestion-based, while throttling is permanent and based on data limit.
- **Can I avoid deprioritization?** You can avoid throttling by choosing a higher data plan, but deprioritization is unavoidable during network congestion.
- **How slow does deprioritization make speeds?** Speeds may slow from 50 Mbps to 10-20 Mbps, but still remain usable.
- **Is deprioritization illegal?** No, carriers can legally deprioritize traffic during congestion for network management.

## 10. Unlocked Phone

### Definition
An unlocked phone is a mobile device that is capable of working with any compatible wireless carrier. Unlike locked phones that only work with a specific carrier, unlocked phones have no carrier restrictions and can connect to any network with appropriate band support.

### Locked vs. Unlocked Comparison

| Feature | Locked Phone | Unlocked Phone |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Carrier switching** | Cannot switch easily | Can switch anytime |
| **SIM cards** | Only accepts one carrier's SIM | Accepts SIM from any carrier |
| **Cost** | Often cheaper upfront | Higher purchase price |
| **Contracts** | Requires service contract | No contract required |
| **Flexibility** | Limited to one carrier | Complete flexibility |
| **Resale value** | Lower | Higher |
| **International use** | Roaming charges apply | Can use local SIM abroad |

### How Unlocking Works
Phone manufacturers lock devices to specific carriers via software. Unlocking removes this software restriction, allowing:
- Any compatible SIM card to be accepted
- Network switching without hardware changes
- Use on any carrier supporting the phone's bands
- No functional difference in performance

### How to Check If Your Phone Is Unlocked

**For iPhone:**
1. Go to Settings > General > About
2. Scroll down to "Carrier Lock" field
3. If it says "No SIM restrictions" → Unlocked
4. If it shows a carrier name → Locked to that carrier

**For Android:**
1. Go to Settings > Network > Mobile Network > Network Operators
2. If multiple networks appear in the list → Unlocked
3. If only one network appears → Locked

**SIM Card Test Method:**
1. Insert a SIM card from a different carrier
2. If the phone requests an unlock code → Locked
3. If it makes calls normally → Unlocked

**IMEI Verification:**
1. Dial *#06# to reveal your IMEI number
2. Check online unlock status using your IMEI
3. Some carrier websites have IMEI lookup tools
