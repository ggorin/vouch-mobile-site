## External Link Best Practices for Geo Pages

### Link Density
- **Target: 3-5 external links per 800-1000 words** (industry standard: 2-4 per 1000 words)
- Spread links throughout content, not clustered
- Use descriptive anchor text (not "click here")

### E-E-A-T Priority Order
1. **Government sources** (FCC, Census, State PUCs) - Highest authority
2. **Academic/research** (MIT Living Wage, BLS) - High authority
3. **Independent testing** (OpenSignal, Ookla, RootMetrics) - Neutral credibility
4. **Industry publications** (CNET, Tom's Guide) - Moderate authority

### What NOT to Link
- ❌ Competitor websites (Mint Mobile, Visible, Cricket, etc.)
- ❌ Competitor pricing pages
- ❌ Affiliate comparison sites with bias
- ❌ Outdated sources (pre-2024)
- ❌ Wikipedia (use primary sources instead)

### Example External Links for California Page
```markdown
According to [Census Bureau data](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/CA),
California has a population of 39.5 million...

The [FCC Broadband Map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/) shows AT&T
