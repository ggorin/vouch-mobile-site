## 1. No Credit Check Phone Plans

### How They Work
- Prepaid phone plans don't perform credit checks because customers pay for service upfront
- No-credit-check carriers are almost always prepaid carriers since there is no risk of missed payment
- Fundamental difference from postpaid: postpaid plans (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) lock customers into contracts where payment happens after the month's service is used
- Carriers perform credit checks on postpaid plans to determine trustworthiness of on-time bill payment

### Carriers Offering No Credit Check Plans
- **Prepaid carriers:** Mint Mobile, Visible, Cricket Wireless
- **MVNO options:** Metro by T-Mobile, Cricket Wireless, Visible
- **Budget options:** Boost Mobile, Tello (starting at $10/month)
- **Example pricing:**
  - Metro's $25/month unlimited plan (with autopay) includes 5G
  - Cricket's $30 plan includes 5G
  - Visible's $20/month deal runs on Verizon's network

### Trade-offs and Considerations
- No-credit-check plans suit users with bad credit or privacy concerns
- Lack financing options for phone devices
- Often mean higher upfront costs (buying phones outright)
- Postpaid plans typically offer perks like free Netflix or hotspot data
- Prepaid plans rarely include these additional perks

### Key Benefit
Accessibility for anyone regardless of credit history, with pay-as-you-go flexibility

## 2. What is an MVNO (Mobile Virtual Network Operator)

### Definition
An MVNO is a wireless communications services provider that does not own the wireless network infrastructure over which it provides services to customers. Instead, MVNOs buy network access from traditional carriers at wholesale rates.

### How MVNOs Work
- MVNOs enter into business agreements with mobile network operators (MNOs) to obtain bulk access to network services at wholesale rates
- They set retail prices independently from the wholesale cost
- MVNOs buy minutes, texts, and data in bulk from an MNO and offer mobile plans to customers like traditional carriers, without maintaining cell towers or spectrum licenses
- MVNOs provide service under their own brand and typically handle billing, customer care, marketing, and sales
- MVNOs rely on the host MNO's core network infrastructure for all voice/SMS/data transport

### Key Benefits
- Low overhead costs allow aggressive marketing to increase customer acquisition
- More options for consumers, potentially at lower prices
- Eliminates substantial investment required to build wireless network and acquire spectrum licenses
- Increased competition drives innovation and pricing

### Types of MVNOs
1. **Reseller MVNOs:** Resell MNO services with minimal customization
2. **Service Provider MVNOs:** Manage billing, customer care, and basic customization
3. **Full MVNOs:** Handle nearly all aspects of service delivery including issuing SIMs and managing customer relationships, while relying on MNOs for radio access only

### Why They Matter
MVNOs provide an alternative to major carriers (AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile) with often lower prices and more flexible plans

## 3. How to Switch Phone Carriers

### Pre-Switch Preparation
- Review your contract for any cancellation fees or device obligations
- Understand your usage by reviewing current billing to identify trends and savings opportunities
- Calculate potential savings with new carrier

### Step-by-Step Process

#### Step 1: Unlock Your Phone
- Contact your current carrier to unlock your phone if it's locked to their network
- Note: You'll need to pay off any remaining device balance before carrier will unlock
- Timeline: Can usually be done over the phone or online

#### Step 2: Check Device Compatibility
- Ensure your phone works on the new network
- Use carrier's online compatibility checker with your phone's IMEI number (15-digit identification number unique to your device)
- Alternatively, consider getting a new device compatible with new network

#### Step 3: Choose Your New Plan
- Compare plans and select one that fits your needs and budget
- Consider data needs, talk/text allowances, and any special features

#### Step 4: Port Your Number (If Desired)
- Provide new carrier with current account information to transfer your number
- Keep current phone plan active during transfer process
- Timeline: Can take anywhere from a few minutes to 24 hours depending on setup and provider

#### Step 5: Backup Your Data
- Save contacts, photos, and apps to the cloud before switching
- Ensures no data loss during transition

#### Step 6: Cancel Old Service
- Only cancel after new line is confirmed active
- Prevents service gaps and accidental overlapping payments

### Important Tips
- Do NOT terminate service with current company before initiating service with new company
- Don't cancel old plan before initiating with new carrier
- Many carriers allow switching over phone or online without visiting a store
- Most of switching process is coordinated between carriers

---

## 4. How to Port Your Phone Number

### What is Phone Number Porting?
Transferring a customer's phone numbers from one phone company (the losing carrier) to a new phone company (the winning carrier). Process requires coordination between both carriers.

### Timeline Requirements

#### Simple Ports
- FCC rules require simple ports (generally not involving more than one line or complex switching equipment adjustments) to be processed in one business day

#### General Timeframe
- Typically 5-10 business days from request to completion
- Can vary significantly by provider

#### Specific Port Types
- **Wireless line transfers:** 10 minutes to 3 hours
- **Landline transfers:** 3-10 business days
- **Complex ports:** Can take several business days to two weeks
- **Extended timelines:** US porting can take 2-4 weeks after documentation approval

### Required Documentation

#### Letter of Authorization (LOA)
- Must be signed by account holder
- Grants permission to new carrier to complete the port
- Information must exactly match authorized user name and service address on losing carrier's Customer Service Record (CSR)

#### Phone Bill
- Scanned or electronic copy from within last 30 days
- Must include account name, owner/authorized user name, and address for all numbers being ported

#### Port-Out PIN
- Generally associated with local US numbers
- Often found in account dashboard with current carrier
- May be required depending on carrier

### Critical Requirement
**Account Status:** Your account with previous service provider must remain active to transfer your number. Do not cancel account until after transfer process is completed.

### Key Success Factor
Exact match between LOA information and losing carrier's customer service record is essential for port completion

## 5. How to Check if Your Phone is Unlocked

### Method 1: iPhone Settings
1. Go to Settings > General > About
2. Scroll down to "Carrier Lock" (or "Network Provider Lock")
3. If it shows "No SIM restrictions," your phone is unlocked
4. If locked, shows specific carrier name

### Method 2: Android Settings
1. Open Settings > Network & Internet (or Connections/Wireless & Networks)
2. Tap Mobile Network
3. Select Advanced/More options
4. Tap Network Operators
5. Turn off "Select automatically" if visible
6. If multiple carrier names appear, phone is likely unlocked

### Method 3: SIM Card Test
- Insert a SIM card from another carrier (doesn't need active account)
- If phone accepts SIM and connects, it's likely unlocked
- Error messages like "SIM Not Supported," "Invalid SIM," or "Enter SIM Unlock Code" indicate phone is locked

### Method 4: IMEI Check
1. Find IMEI by going to Settings > About Phone or dialing *#06#
2. Visit reputable IMEI checker website
3. Enter IMEI number to get lock status
4. Must use trusted sources only (security risk with unknown sites)

### Method 5: Contact Your Carrier
- Call your wireless carrier and ask directly if phone is unlocked
- Can ask them to unlock it while you have them on the line if it's locked

### Why This Matters
Phone must be unlocked to switch carriers. Most carriers will unlock phones free after device is fully paid off or contract is fulfilled.

## 6. eSIM vs Physical SIM

### Key Difference
- **Physical SIM:** Small removable card inserted into device SIM slot
- **eSIM:** Embedded directly into device hardware, programmable remotely without physical swap

### eSIM Benefits

## 7. How to Unlock Your Phone

### Carrier Unlocking Policies

#### FCC Requirements
Carriers are required to unlock phones free of charge after:
- Device is fully paid off, OR
- Early termination fee is paid

#### Specific Carrier Requirements
- **Postpaid devices:** Participants will unlock after fulfillment of service contract or device installment plan completion, or payment of early termination fee
- **Prepaid devices:** Participants will unlock devices within one year of initial activation, consistent with provider's reasonable time, payment, or usage requirements

### How to Request Unlock from Your Carrier
1. Contact carrier directly (can usually be handled remotely)
2. In some cases, software update or unlock code entry may be required
3. Each carrier posts its clear, concise, and readily accessible unlocking policy on their website
4. Can often skip store visit by handling remotely

### Third-Party Unlocking Services
- Alternative option if encountering problems with official carrier unlock
- IMEI unlock services work identically to official carrier unlocks
- Many third-party unlock companies exist
- **Best practice:** Check review sites like Trustpilot before using third-party services
- Use trusted vendors only to avoid scams

### Checking Unlock Status
**iPhone:** Go to Settings > General > About. Scroll to "Carrier Lock." If shows "No SIM restrictions," phone is unlocked.

### Key Timeline
- Carrier unlocks typically happen within 24-48 hours
- Varies by carrier and complexity

## 8. Understanding Phone Plan Data

### What Counts as Data Usage
Anything using internet connection that's not on Wi-Fi uses mobile data:
- Browsing websites
- Streaming videos and music
- Using GPS and maps
- Checking and sending email
- Making video calls
- Playing games
- Scrolling social media
- Using hotspot/tethering (counts toward your data allowance)

### What Doesn't Count as Data
- Text messages (SMS) - use cellular connection, not data
- Voice calls - use cellular connection, not data
- Can still text and call even after using data plan allotment

### How Data is Measured
- Measured in GBs (gigabytes) or MBs (megabytes)
- 1 GB = approximately 1,000 MB

### How Much Data Do You Need?

#### Light Users (5 GB/month for single line)
- Primarily on Wi-Fi when using phone
- Occasional browsing, email, social media
- Family of four: approximately 20 GB total

#### Medium Users (10-15 GB/month for single line)
- Can't always access Wi-Fi
- Regular use of data-intensive activities: social media, streaming, maps, navigation, video calls
- Depend on mobile data more frequently

#### Heavy Users (30+ GB/month or unlimited)
- Rarely on Wi-Fi
- Heavily dependent on mobile data
- Frequent online gaming, streaming entertainment, video calling
- Benefit from unlimited plans that allow 30GB+ before any throttling

### How to Check Data Usage
1. Open phone Settings
2. Tap on Cellular
3. Scroll down to Cellular Data
4. See overall data usage and roaming for current period
5. Tap "Show All" in Cellular Data section to see per-app usage

### Data Management Tips
- Monitor usage regularly to avoid overage charges
- Use Wi-Fi when available to preserve mobile data
- Check per-app data usage to identify data hogs
- Consider adjusting plan if consistently exceeding or significantly under-using allocated data
