---

## MVNO Network Access

### AT&T MVNO Coverage
All AT&T MVNOs (Cricket Wireless, Consumer Cellular, Red Pocket Mobile, H2O Wireless, PureTalk, etc.) access the exact same network infrastructure with these caveats:
- **Deprioritization:** MVNO data is deprioritized behind postpaid customers during congestion
- **Coverage:** Identical to AT&T postpaid coverage
- **5G Access:** Varies by MVNO plan tier
- **Cost Benefit:** MVNOs offer same coverage with lower pricing but potentially reduced priority

---

## Coverage Reliability Considerations

### Roaming Agreements
- AT&T maintains roaming partnerships in areas with weak native coverage
- Allows calls, texts, and data in spotty areas where AT&T doesn't own infrastructure
- Particularly useful in remote rural regions

### Deprioritization During Peak Times
- MVNO customers experience deprioritization
- Urban areas with high demand may see speed reduction
- Less impact in less congested rural areas

### Building Penetration
- Official coverage maps don't reflect indoor/building signal strength
- Dead zones exist inside structures even in covered areas
- Geographic obstacles can create localized weak spots

---

## Geographic Recommendations for Vouch MVNO

### Ideal Markets
- **Tier 1:** California, Texas, Florida, Northeast Corridor (NY, PA, NJ, MA)
- **Tier 2:** Major metro areas nationwide with urban focus
- **Strength:** Metropolitan centers with 99%+ population coverage

### Caution Markets
- **Consider Alternatives:** Wyoming, Nevada, parts of Arizona/New Mexico for rural penetration
- **Mixed Coverage:** Maine, Alaska (limited viability)
- **Recommendation:** Focus messaging on urban/suburban users in these areas

### Rural Market Challenges
- **Expectation Setting:** Rural users should understand coverage limitations vs Verizon
- **Messaging Angle:** Position as balanced choice between urban-focused T-Mobile and rural-strong Verizon
