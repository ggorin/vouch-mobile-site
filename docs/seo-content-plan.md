    }
  ]
}
```

### State Page Schema Requirements

**Required Schema Types:**

1. **LocalBusiness** (primary)

  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "LocalBusiness",

### State Page External Links Checklist

Each state page MUST include links to:

| # | Source Type | Example | Purpose |
|---|-------------|---------|---------|
| 1 | Census data | census.gov/quickfacts/[STATE] | Population/demographics |
| 2 | Coverage verification | broadbandmap.fcc.gov | Network proof |
| 3 | Cost of living | livingwage.mit.edu | Savings context |
| 4 | Network testing | opensignal.com or speedtest.net | Performance data |
| 5 | State regulator (optional) | State PUC website | Authority signal |

**See [SOURCES.md](seo-research/SOURCES.md) for complete list of approved external links.**

### State Page Internal Links Checklist

Each state page should link to:

| Link To | Anchor Text Example |
|---------|---------------------|
| /guides/how-to-switch-carriers/ | "switching to Vouch" |
| /guides/no-credit-check-phone-plans/ | "no credit check required" |
| /compare/vouch-vs-[competitor]/ | "compare Vouch to [competitor]" |
| /tools/coverage-checker/ | "check your coverage" |
| Neighboring state pages | "coverage in [nearby state]" |

### Unique Content Requirements (Avoid Thin/Duplicate)

**Google will penalize pages that are essentially duplicates with city names swapped.**

Each state page MUST have unique:
- [ ] State population and demographic stats
- [ ] State-specific cost of living data
- [ ] Average phone bill for that state (if available)
- [ ] Major cities list (not generic)
- [ ] State-specific pain points or angles
- [ ] Local industry/employer mentions where relevant
- [ ] FAQ answers tailored to state context

**Content Differentiation Ideas:**
- **High cost states (CA, NY, MA):** Emphasize savings vs high cost of living
- **High phone bill states (TX, PA):** Emphasize savings vs state average bills
- **High immigrant population (CA, FL, NY, NJ):** Emphasize no credit check, no SSN required
- **Rural states:** Emphasize AT&T rural coverage strength
- **Tech hub states (CA, WA, TX):** Emphasize 5G, unlimited data for remote workers

### Metro Area Page Template

Same structure as state pages, but with city-specific additions:

**Additional Unique Content:**
- Neighborhood coverage details
- Transit/commuter context (link to transit authority)
- Local competitor landscape
- City-specific testimonials (if available)
- City open data statistics

**Additional External Links:**
- City transit authority website
- City open data portal
- Local news sources (for testimonials/press mentions)
