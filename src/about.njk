      <h2 class="text-3xl mb-6 text-center">Why We Started Vouch Mobile</h2>
      <p class="mb-4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
        The wireless industry has long been dominated by carriers who prioritize profits over people. Complex pricing, hidden fees, credit checks, and long-term contracts have made it difficult for many Americans to get the service they need.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-4" style="line-height: 1.8;">
        We saw an opportunity to do things differently. By leveraging the power of AT&T's network through our partnership, we're able to offer the same great coverage at a fraction of the price—without the barriers that keep people from getting connected.
      </p>
      <p style="line-height: 1.8;">
        Vouch Mobile is for the budget-conscious family looking to save money, the young professional building their credit, and everyone in between who deserves honest, affordable wireless service.
