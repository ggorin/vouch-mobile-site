Thinking about switching phone carriers but worried about losing your phone number? Good news: you can keep your number when you switch. This process is called "porting," and it's your legal right under FCC regulations.

Whether you're looking to save money, get better coverage, or escape a frustrating contract, this guide will walk you through the entire process step by step.

## What is Number Porting?

Number porting is the process of transferring your existing phone number from one carrier to another. The FCC requires all wireless carriers to allow customers to port their numbers, so you don't have to start fresh with a new number every time you switch.

## Before You Switch: What You'll Need

Before starting the porting process, gather this information from your current carrier:

- **Account number** - Found on your bill or in your online account
- **Account PIN or password** - The security code for your account
- **Billing address** - The address associated with your current account
- **Phone number** - The number you want to transfer

## Step-by-Step Porting Process

### Step 1: Don't Cancel Your Current Service

This is crucial: do NOT cancel your current phone service before initiating the port. Your old account needs to remain active for the transfer to work. Once the port is complete, your old service will automatically be cancelled.

### Step 2: Check Phone Compatibility

Make sure your phone will work with your new carrier. Most unlocked phones work across carriers, but it's worth checking. You can usually verify compatibility on the new carrier's website using your phone's IMEI number.

### Step 3: Sign Up with Your New Carrier

When you sign up for your new service, you'll have the option to port your existing number. Select this option and enter your current account information. The new carrier will handle the transfer.

### Step 4: Wait for the Port to Complete

Porting typically takes a few minutes to a few hours, though it can occasionally take up to 24 hours. During this time, you might experience a brief service interruption. Once complete, you'll receive service through your new carrier.

### Step 5: Activate Your New SIM

If you're using a new SIM card or eSIM, follow the activation instructions from your new carrier. Once activated and the port is complete, your number will work on your new service.

## Common Questions About Switching

### Will I lose service during the switch?

There may be a brief period (usually minutes, sometimes hours) where you have limited service while the port completes. Plan your switch for a time when you don't need your phone urgently.

### Can I port a number from any carrier?

Yes, you can port numbers from any wireless carrier, as well as many landline and VoIP providers.

### Are there any fees to port my number?

Your new carrier typically won't charge for porting. However, your old carrier might have an early termination fee if you're under contract. Check your current agreement.
