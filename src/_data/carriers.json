        "answer": "Yes! You can port your existing AT&T phone number to any alternative carrier. The process typically takes a few minutes to a few hours. Make sure you don't cancel your AT&T service before initiating the port, as you'll need your account active to transfer the number."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my AT&T phone work with other carriers?",
        "answer": "Most AT&T phones are compatible with AT&T MVNOs like Vouch Mobile since they use the same network. For carriers on different networks (T-Mobile, Verizon), your phone needs to be unlocked and support their bands. AT&T will unlock your phone for free if it's paid off and you've had it for at least 60 days."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do I get out of my AT&T contract?",
        "answer": "If you're under contract, you may face early termination fees (up to $325). However, you can avoid this by: paying off your device balance, waiting until your contract ends, or switching to a no-contract carrier like Vouch Mobile after your current term. AT&T no longer offers traditional 2-year contracts on most plans."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best AT&T alternative for coverage?",
        "answer": "For identical coverage, choose an AT&T MVNO like Vouch Mobile or Cricket Wireless - they use the exact same towers. Vouch Mobile offers the best value at $30/month with no credit check, while Cricket has physical stores. If you're in urban areas, T-Mobile or Verizon MVNOs are also excellent options."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will I lose coverage if I switch from AT&T?",
        "answer": "Not if you choose an AT&T MVNO! Carriers like Vouch Mobile use AT&T's same towers and network infrastructure, so you get identical coverage. The only difference is you pay less. For non-AT&T alternatives, coverage depends on that network's strength in your area."

        "answer": "Yes! You can port your Cricket phone number to any new carrier. The process is simple - just don't cancel Cricket before initiating the port. You'll need your Cricket account number and PIN, which you can find in your Cricket app or by calling customer service."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my Cricket phone work with Vouch Mobile?",
        "answer": "Since both Cricket and Vouch Mobile use the AT&T network, your Cricket phone will work seamlessly with Vouch Mobile. Cricket phones are typically unlocked if you've had service for at least 6 months, but even if locked, they should work fine on another AT&T MVNO."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do Cricket customers switch to other carriers?",
        "answer": "The top reasons Cricket customers switch include: paying extra for 5G access, experiencing slow speeds due to deprioritization during peak hours, wanting better unlimited plan pricing, and frustration with video streaming quality caps. Vouch Mobile solves all these issues on the same AT&T network."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Vouch Mobile really on the same network as Cricket?",
        "answer": "Yes! Both Vouch Mobile and Cricket are AT&T MVNOs, meaning they use the exact same cell towers and network infrastructure. You'll get identical coverage - the difference is Vouch Mobile offers better pricing and includes 5G at no extra charge."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can I save by switching from Cricket to Vouch Mobile?",
        "answer": "Cricket's unlimited plan costs $55/month, while Vouch Mobile's unlimited plan is just $30/month - that's $25/month in savings, or $300 per year. Plus, you get 5G included free with Vouch Mobile, which Cricket charges extra for."

        "question": "What network is Boost Mobile actually on?",
        "answer": "Boost Mobile operates on both T-Mobile and AT&T networks, which varies by your location and the plan you choose. This can be confusing because you may not know which network you're using. Vouch Mobile keeps it simple - you're always on AT&T's network."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I keep my phone number when switching from Boost?",
        "answer": "Yes! Your phone number belongs to you. Get your Boost account number and PIN from the Boost app or by calling customer service. Provide these to your new carrier when signing up. Don't cancel Boost before the port completes."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my Boost phone work with other carriers?",
        "answer": "Boost phones are typically unlocked after 12 months of service. Most modern smartphones support multiple networks. For switching to Vouch Mobile (AT&T), verify your phone supports AT&T bands. iPhones and recent Samsung phones generally work on all networks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why do customers leave Boost Mobile?",
        "answer": "Common reasons include: confusion about which network they're using, frequent plan and pricing changes, customer service frustrations, and wanting a more straightforward carrier experience. Vouch Mobile offers clarity with dedicated AT&T service and simple pricing."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much can I save by switching from Boost to Vouch Mobile?",
        "answer": "Boost's unlimited plan costs $50/month while Vouch Mobile is $30/month - saving you $20/month or $240/year. Plus you get the clarity of knowing you're always on AT&T's reliable network with consistent, predictable pricing."
