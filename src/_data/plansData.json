      },
      {
        "question": "Is cheap unlimited data actually unlimited?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our unlimited plans are truly unlimited - no data caps and no overage charges. Some plans may have reduced speeds during network congestion after using a certain amount of high-speed data, but you'll never be cut off."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the catch with these low prices?",
        "answer": "There's no catch! You get the same AT&T network, same coverage, same 5G access. The only difference is we operate more efficiently and charge less. No hidden fees, no contracts, no surprises."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my service quality be worse because it's cheaper?",
        "answer": "Not at all. You're using AT&T's same towers and infrastructure. Your calls, texts, and data work identically to AT&T's own customers. The savings come from our business model, not from reduced service quality."
      },
      {
        "question": "Are there any hidden fees I should know about?",
        "answer": "Zero hidden fees. Your monthly price includes all taxes and regulatory fees. The price you see on our website is exactly what you pay - that's our promise."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I really get unlimited data for $15/month?",
        "answer": "Yes! Our Budget Unlimited plan at $15/month includes unlimited talk, text, and data. You get 10GB of high-speed data, and unlimited data at reduced speeds after that. It's perfect for moderate data users."

    "faqs": [
      {
        "question": "What is mobile hotspot and how does it work?",
        "answer": "Mobile hotspot lets you share your phone's cellular data connection with other devices like laptops, tablets, or other phones. Your phone essentially becomes a portable WiFi router that other devices can connect to."
      },
      {
        "question": "How much hotspot data do I need?",
        "answer": "It depends on your usage. 5GB is good for occasional email and light browsing. 10GB works well for regular use including some video streaming. 20GB is ideal for heavy users who work remotely or travel frequently."
      },
      {
        "question": "Does hotspot usage count against my phone data?",
        "answer": "Hotspot data is separate from your phone's high-speed data allocation. If you have 10GB of hotspot, that's specifically for tethering, not pulled from your phone's unlimited data pool."
      },
      {
        "question": "How fast is the hotspot connection?",
        "answer": "Your hotspot uses the same 5G or 4G LTE connection as your phone. In good coverage areas, you can expect speeds comparable to home WiFi - easily fast enough for video calls, streaming, and general work tasks."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I connect multiple devices at once?",
        "answer": "Yes! You can connect up to 10 devices to your Vouch Mobile hotspot simultaneously. Perfect for families or connecting your laptop and tablet at the same time."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens when I use all my hotspot data?",
        "answer": "When you reach your hotspot limit, the hotspot feature pauses until your next billing cycle. Your regular phone service continues unaffected. You can also upgrade your plan mid-cycle if you need more hotspot data."

      {
        "question": "What is an MVNO and how does it work?",
        "answer": "MVNO stands for Mobile Virtual Network Operator. Vouch Mobile leases network capacity from AT&T at wholesale rates and passes those savings to you. You get the same AT&T towers and coverage, just at a much lower price."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is this really the same as AT&T service?",
        "answer": "Yes! Your calls, texts, and data all travel through AT&T's towers and infrastructure. The coverage map is identical to AT&T's. The only difference is the billing - you pay Vouch Mobile instead of AT&T."
      },
      {
        "question": "Will my AT&T phone work with Vouch Mobile?",
        "answer": "Absolutely! Any phone currently working on AT&T will work seamlessly with Vouch Mobile. Just swap in our SIM card (or activate eSIM) and you're ready to go."
      },
      {
        "question": "Do I get 5G on the AT&T network?",
        "answer": "Yes! Vouch Mobile includes full access to AT&T's 5G network at no extra charge. Wherever AT&T has 5G coverage, you'll have 5G coverage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Why is Vouch Mobile so much cheaper than AT&T?",
        "answer": "We don't have expensive retail stores, celebrity endorsements, or massive marketing budgets. As an MVNO, we operate efficiently and pass those savings directly to our customers."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I keep my current phone number?",
        "answer": "Yes! Transferring your number from AT&T (or any carrier) is simple and free. Most transfers complete in under 10 minutes."
