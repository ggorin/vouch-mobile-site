    "fullDefinition": "5G represents a major leap forward in wireless technology, fundamentally changing how cellular networks operate. Unlike its predecessor 4G LTE, which primarily improved upon 3G speeds, 5G introduces intelligent beamforming technology that calculates device location and directs focused, narrow beams of radio energy specifically toward each device.\n\nThe technology operates across three spectrum bands: low-band (sub-1 GHz) provides wide coverage but slower speeds similar to 4G; mid-band (1-6 GHz) balances speed and coverage and is the most commonly deployed; and high-band/mmWave (24+ GHz) delivers ultra-fast speeds but with limited range and building penetration.\n\nBase stations are equipped with large antenna arrays (64, 128, or more antennas) allowing simultaneous transmission of dozens of independent data streams on the same frequency band. This architecture can support up to 1 million devices per square kilometer, making 5G ideal for densely populated areas.",

    "fullDefinition": "VoLTE (Voice over Long-Term Evolution) transmits voice calls as data packets over 4G LTE networks, rather than switching to older 2G or 3G networks for calls. This approach keeps your phone on a single network for both voice and data, improving efficiency and call quality.\n\nThe technology delivers several key benefits: HD voice quality with a wider frequency range that captures speech nuances, faster call setup times (you hear the phone ring sooner), and the ability to continue using data while on a call. You can browse the web, receive notifications, or use apps without interrupting your conversation.\n\nVoLTE is now the standard for voice calls on modern networks. With 375 network operators worldwide invested in VoLTE and 320 already offering the service, it's the default calling technology for most smartphones. As carriers phase out 2G and 3G networks, VoLTE becomes essential for making calls.",
    "howItApplies": "Vouch Mobile fully supports VoLTE on AT&T's network, giving you crystal-clear HD voice calls and the ability to use data while talking. Every call you make with a VoLTE-capable phone benefits from faster connection times and improved audio quality. Since AT&T has sunset its 3G network, VoLTE is how all voice calls work on our service.",

        "question": "What is VoLTE?",
        "answer": "VoLTE (Voice over LTE) is technology that transmits voice calls over 4G LTE networks instead of older 2G or 3G. It delivers HD voice quality, faster call connections, and lets you use data simultaneously while on a call."

      {
        "question": "Is VoLTE the same as WiFi calling?",
        "answer": "No, they're different technologies. VoLTE uses your cellular LTE network for calls, while WiFi calling uses an internet connection. Both deliver HD voice quality, but WiFi calling is useful when cellular signal is weak."

        "question": "Do I need to enable VoLTE?",
        "answer": "VoLTE is typically enabled by default on modern smartphones and carrier plans. If you're unsure, check your phone's settings under cellular or network options. With Vouch Mobile on AT&T's network, VoLTE should work automatically."

        "question": "Why does VoLTE matter now?",
        "answer": "With carriers shutting down older 2G and 3G networks, VoLTE is now required for making voice calls on most networks. If your phone doesn't support VoLTE, you may not be able to make calls on modern networks."

It stores your International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), phone number, and security keys that authenticate your device. Without a SIM card or eSIM, your phone cannot make calls, send texts, or use mobile data.\n\nPhysical SIM cards come in different sizes: Nano SIM is the smallest and most common in modern phones, Micro SIM was widely used from 2010-2015, and Mini SIM (the original size) is rarely used today. Most carriers provide 3-in-1 SIM cards that can be punched out to fit any size.\n\neSIM (embedded SIM) is built directly into your phone's circuitry and programmed remotely via QR code or carrier app. Benefits include instant activation without waiting for a physical card, the ability to store multiple carrier profiles, and easier switching between carriers. Many newer phones support both physical SIM and eSIM, enabling dual-SIM functionality.",

The trade-off is that unlocked phones usually cost more upfront since carriers subsidize locked phones in exchange for service commitments.\n\nTo check if your phone is unlocked: on iPhone, go to Settings > General > About and look for 'No SIM restrictions' under Carrier Lock. On Android, go to Settings > Network > Mobile Network > Network Operators; if multiple networks appear, it's unlocked. You can also try inserting a SIM from a different carrier.",
